## Step 1: 分析專案結構與設定 (Completed)
*   **Action:** Reading key configuration files.
*   **Summary:** The project is a modern, containerized Django e-commerce application using Python 3.12, PostgreSQL, and `uv` for package management. It includes apps for accounts, products, cart, and orders. Key libraries include `django-allauth` for authentication and `crispy-bootstrap5` for forms. The configuration reveals several security risks for production, such as a hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG=True`. Database credentials are also hardcoded. The project is configured for Traditional Chinese (`zh-Hant`) and includes a library for lunar calendar calculations.

## Step 2: 分析應用程式邏輯 (Completed)
*   **Action:** Reading the source code of the main applications.
*   **Summary:** The application implements a standard e-commerce workflow: product browsing, adding to a cart, a checkout process that enforces user profile completion, and order creation with a final confirmation. The `accounts` app is notable for its custom user model that automatically converts Gregorian birthdays to their Lunar equivalents. The `orders` app uses atomic transactions to ensure data integrity during order creation. The project is well-structured into distinct Django apps for each core feature.

## Step 3: 生成分析報告 (Completed)
*   **Action:** Generating the analysis report based on the findings.
*   **File created:** `Analyze-Project-Progress-And-Suggest-Analysis-Report-20250910.md`

## Step 4: 生成建議書 (Completed)
*   **Action:** Generating the proposal for future development and improvements.
*   **File created:** `Analyze-Project-Progress-And-Suggest-Proposal-20250910.md`
